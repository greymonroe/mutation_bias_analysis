#### Monroe et al. 2021. **Mutation bias reflects natural selection in *Arabidopsis thaliana***. *Nature*

Specific functions are maintained in the R package polymorphology https://github.com/greymonroe/polymorphology

## Purpose of this repository
<<<<<<< HEAD
Our aim is enable researchers to make use of data on mutaton bias in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. We are providing a series of vignettes in the *code* directory that correspond to results of the paper and highlight the structure of the underlying data.
